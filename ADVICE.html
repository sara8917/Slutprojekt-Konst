    <ol class="important_points">
        <li>When dealing with oil paint is the matter different. You can try removing the paint of the 
            canvas - if that is possible. Otherwise, you can let it dry and paint a new layer on top. 
            you can always do both. </li>
        <li>It's very important to have patient, it takes about a week for one layer to dry before you
            can start with the next one. Don't rush otherwise The colors you put on top will mix 
            together. So the paint dry faster you can: xix your paint with a solvent like turpentine 
            or Liquin. And use Linseed oil, safflower oil, and liquin are oils, to make your 
            paint consistently smooth and brushable.</li>
        <li>You shouldn't be afraid to try, getting better is all about practise. You can fix mistakes 
            but you learn by trying.</li>
        <li>I highly recomend using newspaper. Put some newspaper on the floor and start painting you can 
            always use the same over again. Newspaper is useful when wiping brushes and to prevent paint coming 
            on your mat etc. </li>
        <li>Last thing I want to mention, is to clean the brushes. Oil paint unlike watercolours is very
            hard to remove and if you you will ruin you bushes if you dont clean them. To clean the 
            brushes do i recomend painting the left paint on you newpaper, and use any tinner you have 
            Then gently wipe them down using paper towels. And if you don't have that, simply 
            use soap and water. </li>
        </ol>

<div class="doing-it">
    I love painting using oil colors - it's probably the hardest out of them all, so why do i like it? 
    <ul>
        <li>The outcome is very nice, I like the colors in oil paint. </li>
        <li>The painting process is very nice for example is it easier to use tools (like the knifes set). 
            Oil paint is thicker than any other that is. </li>
        <li>The fact that my canvas doesn't dry as I am working on it is very useful
            and I don't mind the drying process. </li>
    </ul>
