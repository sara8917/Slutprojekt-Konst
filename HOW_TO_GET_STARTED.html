        <li>First thing first, before you start, it is important to know what you are about to do. 
        Think of an idea before everything, you could check our insipiration page to for help and inspiration. 
        Once you have an idea can you move on but it could be easier for you if tou sketch it down</li>

            <li>Water colors: You need to prepare a glas filled with water, the brushes you will use for painting, 
            some tissues to use and it's good to have newspaper you use so you don't dirty anything and a 
            board you can put your paper on top. </li>
            <li>Oil colors: When using oil paint, do you not need water but a cloth instead and that's to remove 
            the paint off of your tools. Newspaper is also crucial here because oil paint is hard to remove. 
            Acrylic is very similar to oil. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>When you start paiting do you usually start with the back ground. Remember that oil colors 
            take a very long time to dry and therefore do you usually paint once a week and the rest 
            is waiting for the paint to dry. </li>
